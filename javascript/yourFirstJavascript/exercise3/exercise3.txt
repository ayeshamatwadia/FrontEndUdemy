// Make a Calculator! using prompt(), and variables, make a program that does the following:
// 1. Prompts the user for first number.
// 2. Stores that first number
// 3. Prompts the user for the second number.
// 4. stores that number and responds with the SUM by using an alert.

var first = prompt("What is your first number?");
var second = prompt("What is your last number?");
var sum = Number(first) + Number(second);
alert(sum); 

// BONUS: Make a program that can subtract, multiply, and also divide!

// This is the same as above except with a different operation applied in the sum calc
