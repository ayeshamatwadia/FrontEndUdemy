// This is some new code I learned ie prompt() note hit shift enter to enter more than 1 line in the console 
// to be run in the browser console

// VARIABLES - VAR
var numberOne = prompt("Please enter the first number");
var numberTwo = prompt("Please enter the second number");

// since prompt brings in the inputs as strings we need to convert them to numbers

var sum = Number(numberOne) + Number(numberTwo);

alert("Your Sum is " + sum);
